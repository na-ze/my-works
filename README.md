# ***This repository is needed to store my works in programming and blender***

All my works will be here, starting from modeling, ending with programming, in the future the list may be replenished.  
Examples for work in a blender I took from:
- Kaino(https://www.youtube.com/@kaino_university)
- Blender 3D(https://www.youtube.com/@Blender3dUa)
- Blender Made Easy(https://www.youtube.com/@BlenderMadeEasy)
- Blue Inversion(https://www.youtube.com/@blueinversion)
